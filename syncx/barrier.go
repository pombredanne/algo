// A Barrier is a rendezvous point for a set of goroutines.
//
// The number of goroutines that are going to use the barrier must be known
// at construction time.
//
// A Barrier differs from a sync.WaitGroup in that a Barrier can be reused.
// A WaitGroup wg can be used as a one-off barrier by having goroutines
// synchronize using
//	wg.Done()
//	wg.Wait()
// However, when the last goroutines arrives, all goroutines immediately resume
// execution, without waiting for the WaitGroup to be reset. If any goroutine
// reaches its Done call before the reset, it panics. Barrier does not suffer
// from this problem and will makes goroutines Wait until the reset is
// complete.
